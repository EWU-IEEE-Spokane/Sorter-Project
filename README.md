# Sorter-Project
This is where we host our documentation and code for the Industrial Sorter Project.

# Minutes 10/25/2020

We started our meeting this week with a presentation from Matt on the image processing
- He successfully coded a working algorithm in Matlab
- Next steps are to get some pictures of skittles that will reflect the final output to test the algorithm, and coding the algorithm in C
- We discussed how the camera interfaces with the Tm4C

Cody is working on the final touches for the mechanical design
- Depending on how complex importing 3D models from 360 to Blender will be, Jaidon will make an animation of the sorter


# Minutes 10/18

Mechanical design
    - Cody has had software issues with Fusion 360, so he is considering buying some aluminum extrusion to finish up

User Interface
    - For the user interface, we are aiming for some status lights
        - Idle, run, pause, stop
    - And 3 buttons
        - Start, pause, and E-stop

Parts Distribution
    - Amy has the funds to send parts out if anyone needs any

Pictures for the Easterner
    - We spent a good amount of the meeting taking some in-meeting pictures for the Easterner to use in the story about our club

Member list
    - We came up with an exhaustive list of club members, and estimated class years for each member


# Minutes from 10/4
We came up with a schedule to prepare for the sorter project presentation on November 18th at 5-6pm. The schedule was posted by Cody, here and on Discord.

We talked about a few ideas for the user interface:
- Using a mini industrial control panel
- Creating a PCB for it
- Attaching LEDs to some type of board

We discussed progress of the image processing:
- Possible use of a raspberry pi
- Issues with tm4c interfacing with camera

Upcoming Events:
- a capture the flag event on Tuesday with Gonzaga, time TBD.
- an educational cyber security event mentioned by Stu (talk to Amy for more info.)
- IEEE day on Tuesday October 6th 11-1pm: come see guest speakers, and participate in a competition of ideas.
- Career center meeting Thursday at 2pm
- A visitor from Easterner magazine is coming to talk during the meeting on Wednesday.

Special thanks to John for signing up to IEEE!



# Minutes from 9/27
We discussed the following miscellaneous:
* Image processing projects, and some examples of OCR with Python were shown by yours truly (Jaidon)
* Possibility of changing meeting times: Friday, or later Tuesday?
