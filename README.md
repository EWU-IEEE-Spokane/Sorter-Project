# Sorter-Project
This is where we host our documentation and code for the Industrial Sorter Project.

# Minutes from 10/4
We came up with a schedule to prepare for the sorter project presentation on November 18th at 5-6pm. The schedule was posted by Cody, here and on Discord.

We talked about a few ideas for the user interface:
- Using a mini industrial control panel
- Creating a PCB for it
- Attaching LEDs to some type of board

We discussed progress of the image processing:
- Possible use of a raspberry pi
- Issues with tm4c interfacing with camera

Upcoming Events:
- a capture the flag event on Tuesday with Gonzaga, time TBD.
- an educational cyber security event mentioned by Stu (talk to Amy for more info.)
- IEEE day on Tuesday October 6th 11-1pm: come see guest speakers, and participate in a competition of ideas.
- Career center meeting Thursday at 2pm
- A visitor from Easterner magazine is coming to talk during the meeting on Wednesday.

Special thanks to John for signing up to IEEE!
