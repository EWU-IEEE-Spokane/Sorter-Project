# Minutes 11/29/20

We started our meeting looking at the data sheet for the cameras we will be using
    - voti.nl/docs/OV7670.pdf
We also discussed ways to reduce glare in the sorter cups
    - Using a cloth like felt to absorb light
    - Doing the filtering entirely with the image processing algorithm
We talked about ways of getting camera data from the microcontroller to a visible photo
    - Exporting data through UART into a text file, and parsing with some programming language
